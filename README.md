Project Description: Examination System
Overview
This program is designed to manage an examination system where multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blanks, and single-word questions can be stored and evaluated for multiple examinees. The system allows adding new examinees, questions, and answers, and provides functionalities to display the stored data and calculate various statistics related to the performance of examinees. It includes features for reading from and writing to files, ensuring persistent storage of data.
Java Features Used
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

The user is presented with a menu of options to interact with the system.
Based on the user's choice, the program performs actions like adding new data, displaying data, calculating statistics, and saving data.
The program ensures data persistence by reading from files at startup and writing to files before exiting.
This examination system provides a comprehensive way to manage and evaluate examinees' answers, leveraging Java's OOP capabilities, collections framework, and file I/O operations.
